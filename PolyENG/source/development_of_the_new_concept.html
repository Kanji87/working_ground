                        <p>In April 2010 President Dmitry Medvedev ordered the Russian Government to develop a Concept of the Science Museum on the basis of the Polytechnic Museum. The Polytechnic Museum Development Foundation conducted an international tender on the Museum’s Concept development.</p>
                        <p>The Competition was announced in July 2010 as one of the major stages of the large-scale project for redevelopment of the Polytechnic Museum, aimed at creation of a modern scientific, technological, social, educational and cultural center on the basis of the oldest technological museum of the country.</p>
                        <p>Leading Russian and foreign companies in the field of museum and educational centers’ concept design were invited to participate in the Competition. The Jury Panel, featuring Russian Minister of Culture, heads of the top Russian and international science centers and enterprises, at its first meeting evaluated 14 applications and voted for the companies to be included in the short-list. The projects of the following companies will be presented to the Jury Panel at the final meeting:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>CosmoCaixa (Spain);</li>
                            <li>Event Communications (UK/Ireland);</li>
                            <li>Ralph Appelbaum Associates (USA);</li>
                            <li>Lord Cultural Resources (Canada/France).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>From October, 2010 to February, 2012, the competition-winning Event Communication, collaborated by the Russian experts and the Museum’s team, worked out the Museum Formation Concept, which was approved by the Board of Trustees and affirmed by the Order of the Russian Ministry of Culture.</p>
                        <blockquote>The project represents nothing less than the rebirth of an iconic institution and we are delighted to be able to assist with such an important cultural advance.</blockquote>
