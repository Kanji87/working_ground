                        <p>The competition for the Polytechnic Museum’s new brand design development took place in summer 2013. The participants were invited to work out the elements of the Museum’s visual identity: logo, brand colors and fonts, as well as to elaborate the concept for further development of the brand.</p>
                        <p>At the first stage of the competition, professional designers, students of art schools, design studios and bureaus submitted their brand design portfolios to the selection panel. During the second stage, the five participants included in the Jury’s short list developed their concept of the Museum’s brand design. Two teams were later selected for the final stage, where they were to develop the visual identity in details.</p>
