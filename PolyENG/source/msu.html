                            The project idea came from the desire to communicate with the architecture of the past and at the same time come into conflict with it. The monumental architecture of the surrounding buildings is in contrast with this new building that is imposing but expresses a formal complexity underlined by the color of copper pre-oxidized that covers it. The project is composed of four elements that make up a sculpture of irregular geometry, as cut by the wind.
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>The building will be located at the territory of the MSU’s campus at the Sparrow Hills. The Museum and Educational Center is intended to become a platform for discussions and continuous communication with the Russian and international scientific community. This will help the Museum to keep its state of the art and be flexible designing the exhibitions, educational programs and interaction with the audience.</p>
                        <p>The Open Storage will be relocated to this site as well, in addition to the science art gallery, science movie theater and media center. The venue, scheduled to be completed by 2017, shall become museum and educational center of the international level and illuminate the cultural landscape of Moscow.</p>
