                        <p>The opening of the RDS exhibition at VDNKh was the key event of the year. The new venue provides an opportunity for the Museum to continue its exhibition projects during the ongoing renovation of the Historical building, and the display itself prototypes the new format for the future permanent exhibition. Another exhibition project to launch was Open Storage, making the Museum’s depository accessible for the general audience.</p>
                        <p>In 2014, the Museum keeps expanding its enlightenment activities. While developing the existing projects in education and science communication, it gives a start to the ambitious programs, approaching new fields and formats, engaging with Russian and international science, art, community and industry.</p>

                        <p>In 2013, the history building of the Polytechnic Museum was closed for renovation. Transportation of the collection to the temporary depositories became one of the principal tasks. The development of the architectural project of the historical building’s reconstruction and renovation proceeded; elaboration of the construction design for the Museum and Educational Center of the Polytechnic Museum and Lomonosov MSU also started that year.</p>

                        <h3>2012</h3>
                        <blockquote><p>It is the year of the 140th anniversary of the Museum that will be remembered for dramatic events, ceremonies and new projects, as well as large amount of work performed by personnel of the museum throughout this year of sweeping changes. It heralded a new era for the Polytechnic Museum and represented a specific boundary between the two essences thereof, namely, the traditional and the renewed museum.</p></blockquote>
